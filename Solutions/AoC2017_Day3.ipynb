    "\n",
    "Let's first take a look at a  \"brute force\" method, i.e we'll actually go and calculate out the spiral. Doing so seems somewhat complicated at first, but we can find a pretty simple pattern among the way the numbers are arranged: `1R, 1U, 2L, 2D, 3R, 3U, 4L, 4D, 5R, 5U, ...` where `3L` means you move left three times (and have a number in each spot). So the pattern for travel seems to generally be `move X, turn, move X, turn, move X+1, turn, move X+1, turn, ...`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make a Python [generator](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators) (think of it as a sequence that you call .next() on to get the next in the sequence) for the spiral indices. What we'll do is maintain our current spot in space `(x,y)`, a direction to travel `(dx,dy)` (e.g up would be `(0,1)`), and a distance to travel before turning, `distance_to_travel`. Whenever we turn to the left or to the right (i.e a turn to face a horizontal direction) we increase `distance_to_travel` by one."

The next time you call `next` it will continue \"where it left off\" (so the function execution doesn't start all over). It also works as you'd expect in things like for loops.

For instance, if we know we're currently traveling up in the spiral we know everything to the right will be 0. If we're traveling left, than everything above us is 0. And so on.

    "The spiral indices generator works out nicely for accomplishing both Part A and Part B, but there are plenty of tricks you can do in Part A to avoid such brute force generation of the entire spiral (and perhaps tricks for Part B as well, although I haven't figured out anything good yet).\n",
    "\n",
    "For one, instead of looking at the spiral as a spiral, we can look at it as layers of squares. For example, the third layer would be\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "17  16  15  14  13\n",
    "18              12\n",
    "19              11\n",
    "20              10\n",
    "21  22  23  24  25\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the `ith` layer is a square with sides of length `2i-1` (since at each layer the side length increases by 2). This means that the total perimeter of each square is `4*(2i-3) + 4 = 8*(i-1)` (imagine the sides without the corners then adding the corners back in). We can also note that the bottom right corner of the `ith` layer will be `(2i-1)^2` (which makes perfect sense since the `ith` layer is a square with sides of length `2i-1` so the area, i.e the total number of numbers in the square, should be `(2i-1)^2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "So... how does any of this actually help us? Well, note that if you're on the top or bottom side, then the layer square you're on minus 1 is exactly the y-distance (think if it as the number of layers you need to traverse) to the center. Similarly, if you're on the left or right side, the x-distance to the center is just your layer number minus 1. The layer that some number `n` is on is just `i` satisfying `(2(i-1)-1)^2 < n <= (2i-1)^2`. Think of this as being between two consecutive odd squares (since each odd square signals the \"end\" of a spiral layer). So since 15 is between the second odd square (9) and the third odd square (25), it's on the third layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, so finding the layer tells us one component/axis of the Manhattan distance; how do we figure out the other? Well, let's consider the difference between `n` and the bottom right of the current layer, i.e smallest odd square larger than `n`. This should be enough to tell us where along a side we are, and by considering the distance from where on a side we are and the center of a side we can get the other axis for our Manhattan distance. In other words, we can use the idea that `Manhattan distance = (layer - 1) + (distance to the center of side you're on)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see what we can do once we've calculated `d = (2i-1)^2 - n` (where as before `i` is `n`'s layer). Well for one, we know that every corner is `side_length - 1 = 2(i-1)` apart. So `d % 2(i-1)` gives us our position along any side since every `2(i-1)` moves us to a corner, and then anything left over moves us along a side. As an example, consider 15; it's 10 away from 25, so the first 4 brings it to the bottom left corner, the next 4 to the top left corner, and then the remaining 2 moves it along the side. Now we just need to go from the position along the side to the position at the center of the side. In a side of length `2i-1`, if we count our positions as 0,1,...,2i-2 then clearly the center is just at `2(i-1)/2 = i-1`. So overall, if our position along a side is `p` then the distance to the center of the side we're on is just `abs(p - i + 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so that was a lot of math, but the point is that we first want to calculate what layer we're on , `i`, by looking at what consecutive odd squares it's between. Then we can. `i-1` gives us the distance to the center along one axis. To get the other one, we look at `d = (2i-1)^2 - n` (distance from the bottom right corner). `p = d % 2(i-1)` tells us the position along a side and then `abs(p - i + 1)` tells us our distance from the center of the side, which is the distance to the center along the other axis. So without doing any spiral generation nonsense, we can solve Part A purely mathematically using the following algorithm: "
