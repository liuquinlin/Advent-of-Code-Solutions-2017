    "The above uses a nested list comprehension for brevity (generally I think this should probably be avoided because it can get hard to understand/read, but I think in this case I think it's simple enough to get away with) and takes advantage of Python's `split` function, which splits a string into a list based on the separating string passed in (or whitespace for no argument). Now that we have our spreadsheet in a nice format, we can find the checksum easily by using Python's built in `max` and `min` functions that conveniently already work over lists. List comprehension again lets us do this as a one-liner (and we can even nicely deal with the edge case of empty rows by only looking at the differences of rows of nonzero length)."

    "This one's a bit trickier. We are now told that each row will contain exactly two numbers `a` and `b` such that `a` divides evenly into `b`. Instead of getting the difference between the max and min of each row, we now instead want to find such an `a` and `b` for each row and sum up the values of `b/a`. For instance, if the row was `5 9 2 8` then we want to add 4 to the sum (because `8/2=4` is the only clean division possible between two elements in the row). So, the problem really comes down to figuring out how to find out which two numbers in the row divide properly. The simplest way to do so (and also the only one I've been able to come up with...) is to just iterate through each possible pair and check divisibility. "

Thankfully, we can get around this by noting that a smaller number can never be divided into cleanly by a larger number. In other words, we only care about the pairs `(a,b)` where `b > a` and can ignore `(b,a)` altogether.\n",

    "To ensure this, all we need to do is sort the list we're passing in first. Then if we iterate through the combinations such that in `(i,j)`, `i < j` (which is what we do in teh above for loop), we'll know that `(j,i)` can be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to clean up our code a bit, rather than writing the combination generation with nested `for`s as we've been doing we can use Python's  `itertools` library, which is generally helpful for doing anything vaguely combinatoric. In particular, `itertools.combinations(list, 2)` will return all the combinations of two distinct elements of a list. Note that `itertools.combniations(list, 3)` would give you the triplets, `itertools.combinations(list, 4)` would give you the 4-tuples, etc. . As an example:"

    "Some final notes on timing. Using itertools.combinations like this (or more generally using the `for i in range(N), for j in range(i+1,N)` construct) halves the number of pairs we need to look at for each row, BUT comes at the cost of needing to sort the row. Note however that sorting can be done in `O(N lg N)` while the number of pairs we have to look at is `O(N^2)`, so (at least asymptotically) getting to halve the number of pairs should be well worth the additional sorting for large `N`."
